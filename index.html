   		<h3>About Katelyn</h3>
   		<p>My job history is as varied as my interests. In the past, I've worked as a baker and pastry chef, and most recently as a bariatric dietitian. Now I am a student at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago. I love solving problems, working with my hands, and making things. I enjoy backpacking, food, bicycling, reading, sewing, video games, and of course programming.</p>
