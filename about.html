   		<h3>About Katelyn</h3>
   		<p>
            My job history is as varied as my interests. In the past, I've worked as a baker and pastry chef, and most recently as a bariatric dietitian. Now I am a student at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago, well on my way to becoming a full-stack developer. I love solving problems, working with my hands, and making things -- all attributes that led me to pursue a career in programming.
         </p>
         <p>
            I spend my spare time backpacking, cooking, walking my dogs, bicycling, reading, sewing, and playing video games.

            Originally from Livonia, MI, I've spent most of my adult life on the west side of the state. I went to college at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, returned to Livonia for culinary school, then moved to St. Joseph, MI, for my dietetic internship. I spent four years working as a dietitian in St. Joseph and Niles. Now I live in South Bend, IN, with my fiance Alec and our two insufferable dogs, Maggie and Sherman.
