         <h4>Stereotype Threat</h4>
         <h4>September 4, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
            <em>Stereotype threat</em> is a term coined by social psychologist <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">Dr. Claude Steele</a>. It refers to the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about the group to which one belongs. This can happen along the lines of race, age, gender, sexual identity, socioeconomic status, or likely any other physical or psychosocial attribute (for example, I could imagine stereotype threat happening among those who suffer from chronic illness or mental illness, or those who have a disability).
         </p>

            I cannot personally speak to some of the experiences above, but I can relate my experiences as a woman. I'd like to preface this by acknowledging that my experiences are those of a white, straight, <em>cis</em> woman, and not intended to disregard or minimize the additional struggles that may be faced by those who identify as LGBT and/or people of color (or any other underserved or underrepresented group as above). In other words, I know that I am still benefitting from some major societal privileges despite what I'm going to talk about here.
         </p>

            The older I get, the more I seem to find myself at odds with two warring parts of my identity. On the one hand, I don't want to be held back (or hold myself back) by being a woman. I want to thrive in a field that is currently dominated by men, and that's going to take some backbone. But the other part of me has been thoroughly conditioned over the past 29 years to adhere to all of the expectations of being a woman. This involves ultimately <em>being nice</em>, putting others' needs before my own, avoiding conflict, and not trusting my own thoughts/ideas/feelings.
         </p>
         <p>
            I have found this to be especially true in written and verbal communication. If you've followed anything in the news about vocal fry or uptalk, you know that women are <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/07/can-we-just-like-get-over-the-way-women-talk.html">constantly being criticized</a> for how they speak. Our tendency towards qualifiers and words such as <em>like</em> and <em>just</em> also comes up in our writing. When I wrote emails to my patients as a dietitian, I often felt like it would be so much faster to simply pick up the phone to answer their questions because I wasted <em>so much time</em> proofreading my emails. I needed to sound both authoritative as a nutrition professional and approachable as a confidant. 
         </p>
         <p>
            This strange dichotomy is felt elsewhere in the workplace by women, too. When it comes to asking for a raise or promotion, you're damned if you do and damned it you don't. Keeping quiet makes it much more likely that you'll be passed over, but standing up for yourself might get you labeled "too aggressive." I've experienced both. As a result, I am simultaneously determined to stick up for myself in a future salary negotiation and seriously questioning whether I'm actually capable of doing so.
         </p>
         <p>
            Here are some other instances of stereotype threat that many women will likely identify with:
         </p>
         <p>
            <ul>
               <li>"Dumbing down" your ideas so that your intellect is less threatening to others, especially men</li>
               <li>Allowing others to take credit for things that you produced on your own, so as not to appear possessive, defensive, or self-aggrandizing</li>
               <li>Diminishing your accomplishments to prevent others from feeling uncomfortable by comparison</li>
               <li>Not raising your hand when you know the answer, because suddenly now you're not sure that it's the answer, and what will people think when they hear you give the wrong answer?</li>
               <li>Not raising your hand when you know the answer because you already gave one correct answer today (or two, or seven), even though no one else is raising their hands</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            In other words, what we experience is a self-fulfilling prophecy. "If I say/do _______, and it's perceived as _______, then they'll know that I'm inferior because I am a woman." This behavior is not responsible for the societal perception of women as inferior, rather it is <em>reflective of it</em>.
         </p>
         <p>
            So what do we do? How do we adapt? I'm not sure that I have the answers to those questions. For me personally, I think that I need to learn to have more confidence in myself and my abilities without so much anxiety about how I am perceived as a woman (in tech or otherwise). I need to remember that there are more facets to my personality than simply my gender, and I need to give others the benefit of the doubt that they are not merely judging me on such a shallow level. There are also helpful ideas for reducing stereotype threat of all kinds listed <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html">here</a>.
