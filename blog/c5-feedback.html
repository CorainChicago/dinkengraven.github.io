   		<h3>Cultural Blog - Phase 0 Week 5</h3>
         <h4>This Entry is All About Feedback</h4>
         <h4>August 29, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
            I should preface this entry by pointing out that in my previous career I received little to no feedback, so getting feedback on a regular and consistent basis is new and awesome and terrifying for me.
         </p>
         <p>
            As a dietitian, I received feedback on my performance exactly 1 time each year. Four years in a row I heard all about how I was doing a great job and didn't need to do anything differently except "keep learning." Which, don't get me wrong, was great for the insecure/anxious/nonconfrontational part of my personality. That part could dust off its hands and say, "OK, great! Let's do this again, same time next year!" and I would never have to think about myself critically. (Well, that's not totally true. Having anxiety means you <em>constantly</em> think about yourself critically, but not usually in a constructive way.) For the part of me that loves to face a challenge and stretch my abilities and learn as much as I can, this annual review was worse than useless, it was an excuse to get into a rut and never leave it, which is precisely what I did as a dietitian. This is not to say that the lack of feedback is the <em>only</em> thing that caused me to leave the field, but it didn't help matters either.
         </p>
         <p>
            So with all that in mind, you can likely understand why receiving feedback 3-4 times per week is such a huge shift for me. I like that it's quasi-anonymous (even though it's usually easy to figure out who said what) -- I think we all feel a bit more comfortable providing constructive advice when our names are not directly attached to it. Sometimes the feedback that I received surprised me (a few people described me as calm and collected, when I distinctly remember feeling jittery and nervous! I guess that didn't come through), and others were things that I suspected about myself (e.g., that I am polite to a fault and would benefit from being more assertive). 
         </p>
         <p>
            I remember feeling very anxious right before I received my first set of peer feedback, and then a huge sense of relief when it was generally positive and constructive. I'm not sure what I was afraid of -- everyone that I've met and worked with has been pleasant, funny, and cooperative, so there's no reason to believe that their feedback would be anything but actionable, specific, and kind. Even so, writing feedback for others has been kind of tough! Talking about what went well is easy, but providing constructive feedback can be challenging -- I think part of it is because we're all more or less on the same level, and many of us are used to either receiving feedback from someone higher up or giving feedback to someone "below" us in the hierarchy. Giving peer honest peer feedback is something relatively new to me, and I haven't really done it since college (and even then, we didn't receive much guidance on what to do).
         </p>
         <p>
            Each time I go into a pairing session, I mentally review a few highlights from the feedback that I received, and try to think of what I want to do to keep improving myself as a pairing partner. Pairing itself has been an interesting experience, too. I'm still figuring out how to be a navigator without being a backseat driver, and how to be a driver without solving the entire challenge before my navigator has time to catch up. Communication is a big part of this, of course. One thing that I've been trying to remember to do is to (as navigator) tell my partner, "OK, I'm going to look up ______" or "I'll search the docs for ______", that way they know I'm not just sitting there while they flounder. Likewise, as driver, I try to talk through what I'm typing and pull in my navigator for their opinion (e.g., "Hey, what kind of loop do you think would be best here?"). I also have benefitted from asking/being asked "How do you feel about this so far?" and "What's your understanding of this bit of code?" When we talk about the code out loud, we can make sure we're both on the same page.
         </p>
         <p>
            One of the best parts of pairing has been having someone to share the frustration with, as well as the victories. It keeps me from getting tunnel vision and forgetting to look at the bigger picture. It can be frustrating when your pair is either far ahead or far behind you. When they're far ahead of you, you feel like a burden and you struggle to keep up. In those cases I think it's been best for me to admit, "Hey, I'm totally not getting this right now. Can we back up and talk it over again?" Likewise, I found that any frustration that I felt when my pair was having a harder time of it immediately evaporated when I remembered how that felt for me, and when I offered to go over it with them again. Not only does that solidify my understanding, but it also gets you past that feeling of impatience or frustration. I think it's important to remember that both parties are there to learn and mutually benefit -- there is no competition and no need to be "the best" if it means leaving your partner behind.
         </p>
         <p>
            Overall, pairing has helped the most with making Phase 0 seem less isolated. I think that most of us could have solved any of these challenges independently with time, but working on them together added a social component and allowed us to learn from each other.
