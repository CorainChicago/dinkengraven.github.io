   		<h3>Cultural Blog - Phase 0 Week 1</h3>
         <h4>Preliminary Thoughts on DBC Culture</h4>
         <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
         Ever since I first looked into it, I have assumed that DBC was going to be hard, like <i>really</i> hard, maybe even grueling at times -- but also simultaneously fun, engaging, challenging, and life-changing. These are the impressions that I got from reading about DBC and reactions from people who had been through the program, and they remain much the same after viewing Shereef's video. However, I appreciated his honesty that there will often be two mindsets at work among both DBC students and staff -- the one that says "this isn't what I ordered, this isn't what I wanted," and the one that says "we're all in this together, lets make it the best that it can be." 
         </p>
         <p>
         I've caught myself several times getting frustrated with the explanations and instructions on the Phase 0 materials, struggling to understand what it is that I'm supposed to do. I had a few moments of "This isn't what I paid for!" but then I tried to reframe it in my mind -- I'm not actually angry about the wording, but about my own lack of understanding. I'm not used to being someone who doesn't understand something. I'm used to being the expert, the one who has the answers (at least as far as nutrition is concerned). In short, I'm not used to being uncomfortable and ignorant. That's not anyone's responsibility but my own. That has been my first real moment of ownership this week.
         </p>
         <p>
         This realization is something that I will need to keep coming back to throughout DBC. I will need to keep reminding myself that I'm in charge of my own learning, and I'll only get out of this what I put into it. If I decide to put a lot of negativity into my learning, I shouldn't be surprised at what will come of that. Not that I don't expect to be frustrated at times, but how will I channel that frustration? Hopefully with this knowledge of myself and my own insecurities, I'll channel it toward finding the solution (and asking for help if I need it!).
         </p>
         <p>
         I am a little nervous, of course. This is probably the most intense thing that I've ever done, and there are still a lot of unknowns. But that doesn't dampen my excitement. I have spent a long time stagnated in a career that wasn't quite right for me, and I feel more excited than I have in a long time to learn. I'm pumped to keep pushing myself and to try to get out of my comfort zone anytime I can.
