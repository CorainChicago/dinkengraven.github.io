         <h4>Women in Tech</h4>
         <h4>August 23, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
            It's no secret that there is a dearth of women in tech. This is a topic that has remained a fixture in my household ever since my fiance (also a developer) and I started dating.
         </p>
         <p>
            As a woman entering the tech field for the first time, I am keenly aware of the fact that I am underrepresented in the industry. This is especially obvious to me coming from dietetics, a field dominated by women. I can think of five male dietitians whom I met personally. Thankfully, I can think of far more female devs with whom I've crossed paths, so I do have hope that it's getting better. There has also been a huge push from groups like <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, <a href="http://www.writespeakcode.com/">write speak code</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a> to get more girls and women interested in tech (and specifically women of color with regard to Black Girls Code, which also has partnered with <a href="http://latinostartupalliance.org">Latino Startup Alliance</a> to produce La TechLa, a program aimed to reach Latina youth).
         </p>
         <p>
            All of these initiatives are wonderful. However there is another side to this story that isn't as loud in the media -- <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html">women are leaving the tech industry in droves</a>. According to the LA times, "A Harvard Business Review study from 2008 found that as many as 50% of women working in science, engineering and technology will, over time, leave because of hostile work environments." HALF of us leave. <em>Half.</em> Not 10%, not 20%, but a full 50% of us will leave the field. That's incredible.
         </p>
         <p>
            <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/">Here</a> is an article from Fortune outlining why women leave tech. (The title makes me cringe -- really? We had to play into that trope to get people to read this?) Motherhood plays a role in some women's decision to leave, however as many point out in their interviews it's not motherhood itself, but the fact that is amplifies everything else that they've already had to put up with in the bro culture of tech. When you are trying to breastfeed an infant and you get pressured to come back to work early and the hours are inflexible and you get passed up for that promotion because you seem "preoccupied" or "not good enough" -- is it really hard to see why women find tech unsustainable? (In case you answered yes, that article also highlights casual racism in the form of the only black woman in the office being referred to as Halle Berry, "As in, 'Oh look, Halle Berry broke the website today.'" Ugh.)
         </p>
         <p>
            Look, I get it. We've come a long way from <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/CouchDB_talk">Perform like a pr0n star</a> (double ugh), but let's be honest: We have a long way to go. And as the articles that I've linked to point out, no number of workshops and classes for women will address the real issue: the <em>culture</em>. Empowerment of women is awesome, but we still need more men to get on board with the idea that a workplace shouldn't be hostile towards women. Remember that in this supposed meritocracy, <em>women also have merit</em>. And it's not enough to think it, we need men to act. When you see sexism, racism, ageism, ableism, or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, call it out! The best thing you can do in a privileged position is to use your privilege to improve conditions for others.

         <p>
            I have a great deal of hope for the tech industry, as so many voices have already started to join together to demand better. We live in a time when this information is more widely available than ever, so let's use it well.
