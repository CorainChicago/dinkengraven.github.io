         <h4>Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Version Control</h4>
         <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
          Have you ever had one of those moments where you walked away from a conversation and suddenly thought of a thousand things that you wish you'd said instead, that perfect comeback that you could've made? Or how about if you could go back to that heated political argument that you had with that one uncle (whom you only see once a year anyway), and volley back a perfectly-cited example of why he's wrong?
         </p>
         <p>
          Then version control is for you!
         </p>
         <p>
          Okay, well, that's sort of how it works. Version control allows you to make changes in your code, track them, and alter or delete them as necessary without deleting or otherwise messing up your entire code base. Basically, if you make changes to your code that accidentally unleash Pandora's Box of Bugs, you can return to a previous working version of the code while you debug that hot mess. Similarly, you can track and control the changes made to forked branches of the code before allowing them to be merged back into the master branch. This is where git comes in.
         </p>
         <p>
          Git helps you to keep track of changes with the use of branches and commits. Each time you commit changes, you stage them using the terminal. Staging allows you to review which files have been changed and whether you want to keep those changes or delete them. By creating a new branch before making changes to the code, you preserve the integrity of the master branch. You can mess up six ways to Sunday and decide to scrap the new branch entirely, and the master branch will be unaffected. And because there are several very deliberate steps that must be taken to merge your new branch with the master branch, this is thankfully difficult to mess up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Storing your code on Github has several benefits. The first is that you have a remote repository of your work, so if you laptop decides to become a brick at the end of the day, your data is safely held in another location for retrieval. GitHub's social component also allows you to embrace open source software and the collaborative spirit of programming. You can share your work with others, get feedback, and join projects with people all over the globe. 
         </p>
         <p>
          So there you have it -- git early and git often, and you'll be well on your way to a life of version control bliss.
