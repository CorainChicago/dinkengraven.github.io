         <h4>Abstract Random Thinking Style: The Golden Retrievers of Learning</h4>
         <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
            As a part of our pre-coursework for Dev Bootcamp, we were instructed to take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a> and learn about our own <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>. 
         </p>
         <p>
            According to the link above and a <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-random-learning-style.html">few</a> <a href="http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm">other</a> sites that I looked at, Abstract Random (AR) thinkers thrive in learning environments where we can...
            <ul>
               <li>Learn from others</li>
               <li>Work cooperatively</li>
               <li>Be helpful to other people</li>
               <li>Establish friendly, comfortable rapport with those around us</li>
               <li>Bring harmony to group situations (I imagine this refers not only to conflict resolution, but also making sure that everyone's voice is heard, something I constantly stress about in groups)</li>
               <li>Work on projects that don't have strict guidelines for what must be done (open to interpretation)</li>
               <li>Have personalized learning opportunities (such as projects that we really care about and are interested in)</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            On the other hand, ARs struggle with...
            <ul>
               <li>Working alone</li>
               <li>Attending to details and giving exact answers</li>
               <li>Working within time limits</li>
               <li>Being corrected, especially if the criticism is harsh</li>
               <li>Actually, even receiving positive criticism is hard for us</li>
               <li>Concentrating on one task at a time (a huge struggle for me)</li>
               <li>Having to explain or justify our feelings (ugh)</li>
               <li>Competition (generally, I'd rather compete with myself than others)</li>
               <li>Working with people who don't seem friendly (this probably goes back to our need to bring harmony, connect with others, and be helpful)</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            I also read a bit about how ARs seem to have a highly-developed intuition, particularly about other people. I'm not sure how I feel about the word <em>intuition</em>, as it can be a bit of a fluffy concept (almost on the grounds of a superpower). However, I do notice that I pay an enormous amount of attention to body language and other nonverbal communication, which might be what intuition is referring to here. I am constantly trying to read the emotions of others and gauge the mood of a group. My stress level goes up if I start to feel like there's dischord in the group.
         </p>
         <p>
            So all-in-all, ARs want to help everyone around them, be friends with everyone who is receptive to their particular brand of friendship, and seek harmony with others above all else. Our feelings are easily hurt, we don't want to be "the best" if that means that others suffer in their own education as a result, and we have short attention spans that make it hard to stay on a single task at a time. Basically, we're golden retrievers.
         </p>

            <p class="caption">"I am HELPING!"</p>
         </p>
         <p>
            And while I do feel that most of the AR traits fit me, I don't dislike working alone. For many things, I actually prefer it. I am definitely an introvert, which only means that social contact is likely to drain my batteries (while time spent alone recharges them). However, I have noticed that I greatly benefit from working indepently <em>and</em> as part of a partnership or group. My difficulty with staying on task alone is tempered by a feeling of responsibility to others in the group, so I'm less likely to wander. I also get to fulfill my enjoyment of helping others within a group. Working with others pulls me out of my comfort zone, because I cannot hide my ignorance or pretend to understand what I truly don't (I'm a terrible liar), so I have to occupy a growth mindset (see below) to avoid letting my partner(s) down.
         </p>
         <p>
            I do know that my oversensitivity makes taking criticism difficult. Even compliments make me weirdly uncomfortable sometimes, and I am very quick to give some example of why my work isn't that great. It's an annoying reflex that I'd like to work on. I remember dreading every annual review at work, even though my reviews were always stellar with very little said about what I needed to improve (beyond "keep working at _____"). Whether that's totally reflective of me as a worker, or that it indicates a less-than-robust review process, is not really the point. It's the weird feeling of dread that I get right before I receive feedback, even though I do take constructive criticism well (externally) and put it to good use. I don't usually get defensive about it.
         </p>
         <p>
            I think this feeling stems largely from having periods of a fixed mindset. In a fixed mindset, you're closed-off from feelings of growth. You see your attributes and intelligence as fixed points in time from which no further progress can be made. Those in the fixed mindset often feel anxious and threatened by new challenges that are not easily surmounted -- basically, "If I'm as smart as everyone says, why can't I figure this out?" It's a place of stagnation, and is likely where <a href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">imposter syndrome</a> springs from. 
         </p>
         <p>
            During much of my pre-college and college education, there was a distinct, looming feeling of "Don't fail. Don't <em>ever</em> fail." As a result, I've come to <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/08/12/what-do-students-lose-by-being-perfect-valuable-failure/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20150815">dread failure</a> as much as criticism, if not more. And yet, looking back, failure is probably when I learned the most. This has been especially true in programming -- the moments when I was most frustrated at my broken code were the moments when I learned <em>how the code really works</em>. For instance, one of my methods wouldn't pass the RSPEC test even though I checked letter-by-letter that the output matched. All of my syntax was correct. Except for one thing: I used <code>puts</code> within my method. This produced "nil," which the RSPEC test took as a failure. It took me 2 hours of trial-and-error to figure it out, but guess what? I will never, ever forget that using <code>puts</code> will return nil. If I had just read that fact in a book or article, I would have <em>maybe</em> a 50% chance of remembering it.
         </p>
         <p>
            This openness to failure, this willingness to break things and admit that you don't know something is indicative of a growth mindset. The growth mindset accepts that attributes and intelligence are changeable and can be enhanced throughout the lifespan. The growth mindset readily takes on new challenges and remains eager to learn, often for the sake of learning itself.
         </p>
         <p>
            I anticipate that being on-site will challenge both my introverted and my independent-worker habits, but luckily I have this knowledge heading in. Hours and hours of pairing will probably drain me, so I will need to continually remind myself of the benefits of working collaboratively with others and use my time outside of school wisely in order to recharge.
