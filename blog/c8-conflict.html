         <h4>Merge Conflicts in Long-Term Relationships</h4>
         <h4>September 15, 2015</h4>
         <p>
            I am the type of person who will often try to avoid conflict at all costs, so this is a somewhat uncomfortable topic for me. My tendency for avoidning conflict is not a desirable trait for me, because it means that I am less likely to speak my mind or honestly address a problem and will instead brush things under the rug or try to sidestep hurt feelings. I'm not entirely sure how I developed this habit, but it is something that I would like to work on.
         </p>
         <p>
            In a long-term relationship, conflicts are bound to happen. This can include everything from whose turn it is to do a particular chore, to making huge financial and lifestyle decisions. Any time that two people try to bring their separate, independent lives together for the long haul, there are bound to be some merge conflicts. In many decisions, great and small, you have to decide as a team whether you'll go with one person's changes, the other's, or a combination of the two. Unfortunately, this can be a bit more difficult than simply adding or deleting a few lines of code.

            Cooking and meal preparation has been a pretty consistent source of conflict between my fiance and I over the years. With time and distance, it's easier to understand that this is a result of two different lifestyles coming together as one, but sometimes in the heat of a disagreement it is difficult to keep that in mind. As a dietitian, I am probably more health-conscious than the average person. That's not to say that I don't enjoy indulgence, but I am more likely to think critically about what I'm eating on a daily basis. My fiance is not a dietitian, he's a programmer, so naturally he doesn't think about this stuff nearly as much as I do. (Similarly, I never thought about programming nearly as much as he does until I started learning it.)

            When I was still working full time (I left my job 2 weeks into Phase 0 at DBC), I would get frustrated when I felt like I was the only one planning meals and preparing them. If I didn't have some idea of what to make, we would likely end up ordering take-out or going to a restaurant because we were both tired and unmotivated after work. I enjoy dining out and delivery as much as anyone else does, but I also know that these foods tend to have more calories, fat, and salt than what we could prepare at home. I also did not want to be shoehorned into a gender role simply because I was a woman. So whenever I came home and neither of us had a plan for dinner, I felt agitated, frustrated, and somewhat disenfranchised (e.g., not an equal part of the team). It was hard for me to hide these feelings sometimes, and so we might end up arguing. Arguing of course didn't solve anything, because we weren't communicating the underlying issue.

            Generally, I enjoy cooking. I like to try new recipes and ingredients, and I enjoy the process from start to finish. I love to cook for others. I am the type of person who can look in the fridge or pantry and pull together a few things for a meal without having to follow a recipe. But often cooking at the end of a long day feels like a chore, not an enjoyable activity. My fiance is also good at cooking, just with a more limited scope. He can follow a recipe, and he makes an amazing burger or steak (seriously, I would rather have a steak at home than at just about any restaurant, and I love me some steak). He doesn't have as much training and practice in cooking as I do, so it's much more difficult for him to open the fridge and make up a meal on the spot.

            Over time, we've come to understand these things about each other. My strengths are planning and thinking on my feet in the kitchen, and his strengths are doing a few certain dishes really, really well and bringing in new recipes or techniques that he reads about online (scrambled eggs with creme freche, beef wellington, mushroom-encrusted steak -- all things I <em>never</em> would have thought of on my own but have become some of my all-time favorites). If we have everything on hand for a particular meal, either of us (or both) can cook it, otherwise I can look around and try to come up with something on the fly.
         </p>

            We also got on the same page about dining out (or at least a lot closer than we used to be). In the interest of saving money and eating better, we now generally limit dining out to the weekends. We even teamed up to start preparing a week's worth of lunches together every Sunday. Sometimes we go even further and made breakfast burritos or breakfast sandwiches for the freezer. This work up front saved a lot of time, effort, and frustration during the week, and we both felt better as a result.
         </p>
         <p>
            If I could go back in time, I would try to notice these things about my fiance earlier. I think that a lot of future conflicts could be resolved quickly and more amicably if we both took the time to recognize and acknowledge each other's strengths, and then found a way to make these strengths complement one another rather than trying to force our lives to merge without any regard to the differences.
         </p>
         <p>
            This approach could be applied to conflicts with others, too. In some ways it mirrors the format for providing feedback at DBC -- discuss what went well first, then provide actionable, specific, and kind feedback. In this case, it's acknolwedging strengths first, and then trying to find a way to pull those strengths together into a workable solution.
