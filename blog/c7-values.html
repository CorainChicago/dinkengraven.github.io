         <h4>Values - How to Combat Stereotype Threat with Affirmations</h4>
         <h4>September 13, 2015</h4>
   		<p>
            Consider this a continuation from my <a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">previous post</a> on stereotype threat.
         </p>
         <p>
            According to <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">reducingstereotypethreat.org</a>, one way to push back against the pressures of stereotype threat is to provide self-affirmations. This refers to the process of thinking about "characteristics, skills, values, or roles" that are important to the individual. The goal is to review these positive attributes in order to bolster confidence and foster self-reliance in the face of stereotype threat.

            When I think of the times in my life when I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, several different values come to mind. I'll discuss a few of them here.
         </p>

            I did a lot of backpacking in college as a part of a group, but never a trip on my own. This year I planned my first backpacking trip since college with my friend Emily, and together we figured out everything on our own. We planned the route, the supplies we'd need, our travel to the park, our meals, and every single detail. We had an amazing time. Even the rangers at the park remarked not only surprise at seeing two women on a multi-day backpacking trip, but they were also impressed by our route planning and preparation. Accomplishing all of this together represents the values of <em class ="accent">independence</em>, <em class ="accent">physical challenge</em>, <em class ="accent">friendship</em>, <em class ="accent">teamwork</em>, and <em class ="accent">self-reliance</em>.

            I loved my job as a baker. I got to be creative, work with my hands, and produce something that people loved. There is no greater satisfaction to me than making something for others to enjoy and appreciate. And of course, who doesn't like baked goods? I took a great deal of pride in my work, and it's still something that I love to do at home. For me, baking represents the values of <em class ="accent">creativity</em>, <em class ="accent">pleasure</em>, and <em class ="accent">meaningful work</em>.
         </p>
         <p>
            In general, think that I try to live up to each of these values. In fact, many of those experiences and values are what attracted me to programming in the first place. I want to create meaningful code that can be used by others, and I want to take pleasure in my work and enjoy a creative field. I also want to build relationships with coworkers and the community itself. In other words, I don't want to just have a job. I want to do work that is meaningful and fulfilling. (I also understand that it won't be sunshine and rainbows all the time, and that some days it will feel like just a job. That's OK.)
         </p>
         <p>
            I think that keeping these things in mind will help me to renew my self-confidence when faced with stereotype threat. By remembering what attracted me to code in the first place, I will hopefully be less likely to succumb to external and internal pressures within a challenging profession. Other things that will help me on rough days include exercise, talking to family/friends, or working on something just for fun (programming or otherwise).
