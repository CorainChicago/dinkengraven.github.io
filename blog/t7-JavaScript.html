         <h4>Looping in Ruby & JavaScript</h4>
         <h4>September 13, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        Loops are central functions of many programming languages. They reduce repetitive tasks and allow you to iterate through data much more quickly. Imagine if you wanted to print a series of numbers to the screen. It would be tedious to write a single line of code for each number. Instead, you can set a loop to execute this in a much faster, more concise way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a while loop in Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>
          x = 0
          while x <= 3 do
            puts "#{x}. Woohoo! I'm in the loop!"
            x += 1
          end

          <em># here's the output...</em>
          0. Woohoo! I'm in the loop!
          1. Woohoo! I'm in the loop!
          2. Woohoo! I'm in the loop!
          3. Woohoo! I'm in the loop!
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        And here is the same loop executed in Javascript:
      </p>
      <p>
      <pre><code>
        x = 0
        while (x <= 3) {
          console.log(x + ". Loopin' it!");
          x++
        };

        <em>// here's the output...</em>
        0. Loopin' it!
        1. Loopin' it!
        2. Loopin' it!
        3. Loopin' it!
      </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        They're nearly identical apart from punctuation and minor syntactical differences. Each loop executes its block so long as its conditional statement is true. In this case, we've controlled the loop with an incremental counting variable, x. Things are a bit different when you compare for loops between languages. Let's look at Ruby first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>
          for x in 1..3
            puts x
          end

          <em># output:
          1
          2
          3</em>
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        And now in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>
          for (var i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
            console.log(i);
          };

          <em>// output:</em>
          1
          2
          3
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, both loops produce the same output, but by different means. The Ruby loop says, "for each number 1 through 3 inclusive, print (well, puts) the number to the conole." The JavaScript loop again uses a counter variable. The part in parentheses groups together the counter variable, a while loop conditional (in this case, while i is less than or equal to 3), and a change to the counter variable (i++ means "add 1 to i each loop"; you could also decrement by 1 using i--).
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, each loop can also be used to iterate over a data structure, such as an array. Again, we'll look at Ruby first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>
          ary = ["a", "b", "c"]

          for x in ary
            print x + " #{x.upcase}"
          end

          <em># output:</em>
          a A
          b B
          c C
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we are telling Ruby, "for each letter 'x' in the array ary, print the letter, a space, then the upcase version of the letter on the same line." Let's now look at how we could achieve the same thing in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>
          var ary = ["a", "b", "c"]; 

          for (var i = 0; i < ary.length; i++) {
            console.log(ary[i] + " " + ary[i].toUpperCase());
          };

          <em>// output: </em>
          a A
          b B
          c C
        </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        We achieve the same result by different means. Again, our for loop uses an incremental variable i to pull out the value held at the corresponding index within the array. This overview of loop similarities and differences between Ruby and JavaScript is certainly not exhaustive, but hopefully provided you with the basics.
